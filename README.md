# GoThink

Advanced MCP server combining systematic thinking, mental models, and stochastic algorithms for enhanced AI decision-making.

**Author**: W. Alec Akin ([@rainmana](https://github.com/rainmana)) | [Website](https://alecakin.com/about)

> **Acknowledgments**: This project is based on the excellent work from the [Waldzell MCP](https://github.com/waldzellai/waldzell-mcp) repository, specifically the [clear-thought](https://github.com/waldzellai/waldzell-mcp/tree/main/servers) and [stochastic-thinking](https://github.com/waldzellai/waldzell-mcp/tree/main/servers) servers. We've significantly expanded and refactored these components into a comprehensive MCP server with community-driven mental models and advanced thinking frameworks.

## Overview

GoThink is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server written in Go that focuses on systematic thinking approaches. It provides AI assistants with powerful tools for:

- **Systematic Thinking**: Sequential reasoning, mental models, debugging approaches
- **Collaborative Reasoning**: Multi-perspective problem solving

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

### Install from Source

```bash
# Install the latest version
go install github.com/rainmana/gothink/cmd/gothink@latest
```

### Build from Source

```bash

## Cloud Deployment

Deploy GoThink MCP Server to the cloud for remote access via HTTP/SSE transport.

### Quick Deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/new?template=https://github.com/rainmana/gothink-web)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/rainmana/gothink-web)

### Deployment Platforms

The HTTP server supports deployment to:
- ✅ **Railway** - One-click deployment with automatic HTTPS
- ✅ **Google Cloud Run** - Serverless container deployment  
- ✅ **Fly.io** - Edge deployment with global distribution
- ✅ **Render** - Simple container deployment

📚 **[Full Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Detailed instructions for each platform

### HTTP Server

The HTTP server enables remote MCP connections via Server-Sent Events (SSE):

```bash
# Build and run locally
make build-http
./gothink-http

# Or use Docker
docker build -t gothink .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 gothink

# Access endpoints
# Health: http://localhost:8080/health
# SSE:    http://localhost:8080/sse
```



## Configuration

GoThink can be configured via environment variables or a configuration file:

### Environment Variables

```bash
export GOTHINK_PORT=8080
export GOTHINK_HOST=localhost
export GOTHINK_LOG_LEVEL=info
export GOTHINK_MENTAL_MODELS_PATH=/path/to/models
```

### Configuration File

Create a `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "port": "8080",
  "host": "localhost",
  "log_level": "info",
  "max_thoughts_per_session": 100,
  "session_timeout": "30m",
  "mental_models_path": "/path/to/models"
}
```

## MCP Server Usage

GoThink is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that communicates via stdio. It provides AI assistants with powerful thinking tools through the MCP protocol.

### Available Tools

The server exposes the following tools:

#### Thinking Tools
- **sequential_thinking**: Perform structured thought progression
- **mental_model**: Apply mental models to solve problems
- **debugging_approach**: Apply systematic debugging approaches
- **list_mental_models**: List all available mental models

#### Session Management
- **session_stats**: Get statistics for a session
- **session_export**: Export all data for a session


### Testing the MCP Server

You can test the server using JSON-RPC messages:

```bash
# Initialize the server
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2024-11-05", "capabilities": {"tools": {}}, "clientInfo": {"name": "test-client", "version": "1.0.0"}}}' | gothink

# List available tools
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | gothink
```

### Integration with MCP Clients

The server is designed to work with MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop. To integrate:

1. Install the server using `go install .`
2. Configure your MCP client to use the `gothink` binary
3. The server will communicate via stdio as required by the MCP protocol

## Mental Models

GoThink includes several built-in mental models:

### First Principles Thinking
Break down complex problems into fundamental components and build up from there.

### Opportunity Cost Analysis
Consider what you give up when making a choice between alternatives.

### Bayesian Thinking
Update beliefs based on new evidence using probabilistic reasoning.

### Systems Thinking
Understand how parts of a system interact and consider emergent properties.

### Error Propagation
Understand how errors compound through complex systems.

### Rubber Duck Debugging
Explain your problem to an inanimate object to gain clarity.

### Pareto Principle
Focus on the 20% of efforts that produce 80% of results.

### Occam's Razor
Prefer simpler explanations when multiple explanations are available.

## Algorithm Selection Guide

### When to Use Systematic Thinking
- **Problem Understanding**: Initial analysis and decomposition
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term decision making
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting complex issues
- **Learning**: Understanding new concepts
